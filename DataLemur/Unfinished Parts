Question:

Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query that determines which parts with the assembly steps have initiated the assembly process but remain unfinished.

Assumptions:

    parts_assembly table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process.
    An unfinished part is one that lacks a finish_date.

Solution:

select distinct part from parts_assembly
where finish_date is null and assembly_step > 1
